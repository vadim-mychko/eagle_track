This is one branch on bounding box tracking, because it's most up-to-date and tested to be working correctly.
This is the version of the system used in the thesis for evaluting the multi-camera system in simulation.
Most recent code (processExchange()) is ugly and contains hard-coded stuff and constants (which ideally should be placed in the .yaml config).
However, if you just want to get the idea of the quality of the code, you're welcome to look at include/tracker.h and src/tracker.cpp
